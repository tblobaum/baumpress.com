The U. S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet announced Wednesday that Iranian vessels attempted to seize two oil tanker ships near the Strait of Hormuz that separates Iran from the Arabian Peninsula.

“The Iranian navy did make attempts to seize commercial tankers lawfully transiting international waters,” said Cmdr. Tim Hawkins, a spokesman for the U. S. Navy’s Fifth Fleet, in a statement to several news outlets. “The U.S. Navy responded immediately and prevented those seizures.”

The Iranian vessels, the U. S. Navy said, fired shots at the oil tankers as part of its attempt to seize the two tankers. Only the second tanker was fired upon by the vessels, and no damage nor casualties was confirmed, officials said.

Both incidents took place in waters between Iran and Oman, the Navy said.

Cmdr. Hawkins did not say how the U. S. Navy prevented the seizure of the ships or provide any further information at this stage. Details regarding the second vessel involved in the incident were not immediately clear.

Oil giant Chevron said that one incident involved the Richmond Voyager, a large crude oil carrier managed by the company. The crew onboard the ship is safe, the company said.

A Chevron spokesperson said “there is no loss of life, injury, or loss of containment” aboard the Richmond Voyager. “The vessel is operating normally. The safety of our crew is our top priority,” the spokesperson added.

British maritime security company Ambrey said a warship with a multinational navy task group was in the area at the time and had requested the Iranian navy to “cease harassing” one of the merchant ships.

The Iranian regime has not yet commented on the allegations. No statements were published to state-run affiliated news outlets as of Wednesday afternoon.

Since 2019, there has been a series of attacks on shipping in strategic Gulf waters at times of tension between the United States and Iran, and the country seized two oil tankers in a week just over a month ago, the U. S. Navy said.

“An Iranian oil tanker, which was seized by a foreign company five years ago, has been returned to the Islamic country in an operation by the Islamic Revolution Guards Corps (IRGC),” state-run news agency IRNA wrote in mid-May about the previous incident.

A prior incident occurred six days before that when the Iranian Navy seized the oil tanker Advantage Sweet while it was transiting international waters in the Gulf. It had departed Mina Saud Port in Kuwait and was heading to Houston, Texas, while being commissioned by Chevron.

The Fifth Fleet at the time said that it was “working with regional allies and partners to increase the rotation of ships and aircraft patrolling in and around the Strait of Hormuz following Iran’s recent unlawful merchant vessel seizures.” A Navy official, meanwhile, said that Tehran is engaging in “irresponsible” and “unlawful” actions targeting merchant oil tankers, which “must stop,” according to a news release.

Navy officials said in the release Iran has harassed, attacked, or interfered with about 15 internationally flagged merchant vessels over the past two years or so.

About a fifth of the world’s supply of crude oil and related products passes via the Strait of Hormuz, described as a choke point between Oman and Iran that connects the Gulf of Oman with the Persian Gulf, according to data from the firm Vortexa, reported Reuters.

The United States, meanwhile, attempted to confiscate cargo of Iranian oil near Greece in 2022, prompting Iran to seize two Greek tankers. Greece’s Supreme Court ordered that the cargo be returned to Tehran, and the Greek ships were released after several months, according to reports.

The daily oil flows via the Strait of Hormuz account for about 21 percent of the daily petroleum liquids consumption around the world, according to data from the U. S. Energy Information Administration.

While relations between the United States and Iran have been poor since the 1979 revolution and regime change, tensions have risen since the U. S. pulled out of Iran’s 2015 nuclear agreement with other world powers. Iran has attempted to resume its nuclear activities while claiming they are for peaceful purposes, and it is also provided drones to Russia for the war in Ukraine.

Washington pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, with former President Donald Trump announcing that it was “one of the worst and most one-sided transactions the United States has ever entered into.” The deal, he argued, “enriched the Iranian regime and enabled its malign behavior, while at best delaying its ability to pursue nuclear weapons and allowing it to preserve nuclear research and development.”
