The suspect in the July 3 mass shooting in Philadelphia that left five people dead has been charged with murder, prosecutors announced on July 5.

The suspect, Kimbrady Carriker, 40, was arrested on the day of the shooting, but his identity wasn’t confirmed until July 5 when he was arraigned on murder and other charges.

Magistrate Naomi Williams ordered Mr. Carriker held without bail, CNN reported. Williams said that “public safety is clearly an issue here” and that no conditions would guarantee Mr. Carriker would appear for future hearings.

Mr. Carriker will remain behind bars until trial, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner, a Democrat, told reporters this week. Mr. Krasner said he expects the suspect will remain in prison for the rest of his life.

Mr. Carriker is a male, according to authorities. However, archived images show Mr. Carriker wearing women’s clothing, and officials used they&#x2F;them pronouns when referring to the suspect. Mr. Carriker has posted on Facebook in support of various groups, including Black Lives Matter, and posted in support of gun ownership.

Mr. Carriker “was exhibiting abnormal behavior for quite a while,” Joanne Pescatore, chief of homicide at the Philadelphia District Attorney’s Office, told reporters on July 5. Mr. Carriker was “becoming more and more agitated” in recent days but other people who lived in the home didn’t alert authorities.

Philadelphia Sheriff Rochelle Bilal said authorities reviewed the posts and found them disturbing. She urged people to call law enforcement if they see concerning posts in the future.

“If you know this person or see a post that raises a red flag, you have to speak up and call the authorities immediately,” Ms. Bilal said.

Mr. Carriker left behind a will, dated June 23, at his home, prosecutors said. A search of the house also uncovered an additional handgun, and ammunition that matched the ammunition found at the scene of the shooting.

Mr. Carriker was convicted of a gun crime in the early 2000s. Mr. Carriker didn’t have a license to carry and wouldn’t be eligible for such a license, based on his previous conviction, prosecutors said.

The shooting occurred in the neighborhood of Kingsessing, in southwest Philadelphia, at about 8:28 p.m. on July 3.

Officers converged on the scene and were able to track down the suspect on foot, Philadelphia Police Chief Danielle Outlaw said. The chase ended with the suspect being apprehended.

The suspect was wearing a bulletproof vest and carrying an AR-style rifle and a handgun, according to the police. The handgun was a so-called ghost gun but wasn’t fired, according to prosecutors. About 50 shell casings were located in the area. Witnesses reported the suspect was wearing a ski mask.

“I thank God our officers were here on scene; they responded as quickly as [they] did. They showed up,” Ms. Outlaw said. “I can’t even describe the level of bravery and courage that was shown, in addition to the restraint that was also shown here. We, unfortunately, have six victims here. But it could have been more had it not been for the officers.”

A second person who was initially apprehended turned out to be a person who is a brother to one of those who were killed, and fired a legally owned weapon at Mr. Carriker. That person was later released.

The victims have been identified as Daujan Brown, 15; Lashyd Merritt, 22; Dymir Stanton, 29; Joseph Wamah Jr., 31; and Ralph Moralis, 59. Two others, including a 2-year-old child, were struck but survived.

The defendant didn’t know the people he shot, according to Mr. Krasner.

Tina Rosette, who used to live with Mr. Carriker, described the man as creative and intelligent. But Rosette told The Philadelphia Inquirer also that Mr. Carriker had “an aggressive approach to some things in life.”

“I didn’t even know he had a gun,” Ms. Rosette said.

Cianni Rosette, Rosette’s daughter, said Mr. Carriker once showed her a handgun.

Among the posts Mr. Carriker shared on Facebook, one said, “How do you know if an evil spirit is following you?”

In another, Mr. Carriker wrote that “we are having a moral problem” and “no guns just means they will user othe[r] means.”

In a third, Mr. Carriker wrote that he believed the government would take away Second Amendment rights.

Other shootings over the long July 4 weekend included incidents in Washington, Texas, and Florida. A day before the shooting in Philadelphia, 30 people were shot in Baltimore; Two were killed. A day after, at least 13 people were shot in Shreveport, Louisiana, including several people fatally.
