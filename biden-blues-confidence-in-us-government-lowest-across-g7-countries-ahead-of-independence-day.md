A new Gallup poll released one day ahead of Independence Day shows confidence in the U. S. government to be the lowest across all countries in the G7.

According to the poll, just 31% of American adults &quot;have confidence&quot; in the U. S. government, down from 56%, the highest in the G7, in 2006. A whopping 69% of Americans said they did not have confidence in the government.

The U. S. was followed closely by the U.K., with just 33% of British adults having confidence in its government.

Among the other G7 countries, Germany ranked the highest with 61% of its citizens having confidence in its government, followed by Canada at 51%, France at 46%, Japan at 43%, and Italy at 41%.

According to Gallup, Americans&#39; confidence in their government has declined sharply over the years, but saw a drop from 46% to 40% after President Biden took office in 2021, and again to 31% in 2022, on par with the lowest levels of confidence reached in 2013, 2016 and 2018.

The poll comes as Biden continues to be plagued by low approval ratings, hovering between 42% and 46% for the past year, according to a recent Fox News poll.

A separate Gallup poll released last week found that just 39% of U. S. adults expressed &quot;extreme pride&quot; in the country, just one percent higher than 2022&#39;s record-low number.
