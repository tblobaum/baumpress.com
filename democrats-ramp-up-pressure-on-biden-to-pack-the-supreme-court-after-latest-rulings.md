Democrats are ramping up pressure on President Biden to pack the Supreme Court following a series of legal losses for the party last week.

The Congressional Progressive Caucus redoubled its efforts to impose term limits and confirm new justices to outweigh the current 6-3 conservative majority. Democrats have also pushed claims that the current court is illegitimate, an argument Biden himself contributed toward after the end of affirmative action last month.

&quot;We must pass Reps. Jerry Nadler, Hank Johnson, and Mondaire Jones&#39; Judiciary Act to add justices and expand the Supreme Court, and their Supreme Court Ethics, Recusal, and Transparency Act to institute a Supreme Court ethics and recusal standard and require disclosure of lobbying and dark money interests,&quot; Rep. Pramila Jayapal, D-Wash., chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said in a Wednesday statement.

&quot;Recent partisan decisions by the Supreme Court that destroyed historic protections for reproductive rights, voting rights and more have undermined public trust in the court — even as inappropriate financial relationships between justices and conservative donors raised new questions about its integrity,&quot; Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., said.

Biden has so far resisted pressure from his party to pack the Supreme Court. When he entered office, he ordered a presidential commission to study the Court and make recommendations about any necessary reforms. That commission&#39;s report recommended against court-packing, a practice many Democrats have pushed to re-term as &quot;expanding the court.&quot;

Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., made sure to keep the door open to court packing in a statement on the commission&#39;s report on June 25.

&quot;It’s been over 150 years since we’ve had an expansion of the court,&quot; Pelosi told MSNBC Host Jen Psaki. &quot;It was in the time of Lincoln that it went up to nine. So the subject of whether that should happen is a discussion. It’s not, say, a rallying cry. But it’s a discussion. The president formed a commission, they did not recommend expansion of the court, that shouldn’t be the end of it.&quot;

&quot;But there certainly should be term limits,&quot; she added. &quot;There certainly should be and if nothing else, there should be some ethical rules that would be followed. I had one justice tell me he thought the other justices were people of integrity, like a Clarence Thomas. I’m like, get out of here.&quot;

Meanwhile, Biden himself faced backlash for undermining the legitimacy of the current court following the recent rulings.

&quot;Today, the court once again walked away from decades of precedent,&quot; Biden said after the Supreme Court ruled against affirmative action. &quot;I strongly, strongly disagree with the court’s decision.&quot;

&quot;This is not a normal court,&quot; he added as he ended the press conference.

Democrats have intermittently denounced the Supreme Court as &quot;illegitimate&quot; ever since the Senate confirmed Justice Amy Coney Barrett prior to the 2022 election. Anger erupted further after the court overruled the landmark abortion decision Roe v. Wade last June.
