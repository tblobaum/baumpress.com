The video captures everything all within a hot minute: the immolated victim, the stunned impromptu camera man, the blazing sirens, charging police wielding extinguishers, the panicked scene that overtook the park. Jesus fucking Christ, it’s a horror show. The day after, the NY Times had a small write-up — Man Who Set Himself on Fire Near the White House Dies From Injuries (May 30, 2019) — but really no story or details were given, and for the most part this day is the last we hear about it. Many other news outlets that reported it did so in a similar minimalist fashion, like a press release. Though Mr. Gupta himself offered no clear explanation for his self-sacrificial event other than a final tweet attributed to him, the contours of his story and work leave some bread crumbs of clues.

I gleaned some insight about the basic background from this short article on Heavy.com, Arnav Gupta: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know, which I abridge below:

He was reported Missing by concerned family on May 29, 2019He was an education consultant and coachHe was an artist, poet, and Green Party memberHe died at age 33 through self-immolation, to which a phone wielding public bore witness locally and virtually.

These facts humanize Gupta and help us understand who he was or might have been. None of points 1–4 suggest that he was deranged or violent, but rather it seems to indicate that he was intelligent and compassionate, fulfilled even. Number 5 is the one thing that people know, if they know anything about this event at all, as most reporting sources gave no details. But he was loved by his family, he was educated, he applied that education to teaching, and he was creative and progressive. This could almost be describing me, except it is not. He also had a documented history of mental health problems, which I can also relate to (as a function of injustice in the world) and have solidarity with solving in the broad sense. But we have little concrete information about what Gupta was struggling with, whether on a personal level or otherwise. We have no suicide note or political manifesto. What would drive a many to such apparent insanity? I will tell you.

There is however a 15 page long poem written by Gupta that satisfies some of that curiosity into his artistry and politics. It appears to be an incredible artefact of who he was, and what he thought and felt. It is a mysterious document, full of sharp geopolitical critique, vivid metaphor, and strong hip hop vibes. Titled Memoirs of a Shadow President (listed on Genius. See also on Scribd), it seems to be a reflection on the Trump era, including a reference to Cambridge Analytica, but from a somewhat transient critical POV. Coincidentally, an expose on Mike Pence is titled The Shadow President. It is all open for interpretation, and I am no authority on poetry, but I certainly can resonate with it’s artistic merit and political significance. Below I list the first four phrases with some of my interpolations:

Whilst you remain

An asylum for the criminally insane

Mark Twain’s Yankee brain rolling all over this polarized terrain.

It’s clear and succinct, rhyming effortlessly, seeming to open with an address to the country itself, a direct comment on the absurdity of the premise of America and its mental health crisis. Mark Twain is invoked, a notable satirist who drew stark contrast across America’s polarization under slavery and after, and how that perhaps leads directly to today in the next words…

Finger on the pulse

Vegas was repulsed

Culture wars leaving the populace tremulous

A reference to mass shootings, in particular the Pulse nightclub in Florida by Omar Mateen, and the Las Vegas shooting, by Stephen Paddock. The issue of guns is always a bloody battlefield in the US, and this expresses acute collective remorse over these events. These cases were both framed largely in terms of identity crisis and the breakdown of authority, which leads into the next lines…

Battlelines are drawn

The Order of the Golden Dawn

Tribal elders looking forlorn

A grim invocation of the occult and our failure to reconcile conflicts. Perhaps lamenting the slide into fascism such a sinister memetic election represents. Perhaps also an allusion to the Golden Dawn neo-Nazi party in Greece. These types of things are thus far the legacy of the Trump administration.

We must protect this house

Not quiver like some Obama mouse

Louis C. K. jerking off on a fallen Angel’s blouse

This seems like a desire to protect the apparent sanctity of the White House, a stand in for the country, acknowledging how Obama’s legacy and diplomatic skills did nothing to stop Trump becoming his successor. We must do better. Gupta then seems to scorn popular culture and the hypocrisy of powerful men in the #MeToo era, taking a shot at disgraced comedian Louis C. K.

The poem continues to unfold along these diverse lines, lamenting the erosion of Obama, noting the Iran deal loss amidst the general clash of civilizations and hyper-capitalist pearl clutching. The next line invokes the ‘art of the New Deal’, or lack thereof, a double-entendre also referring to Trump’s (bad) deal-making. Each line compresses some vivid insight or imagery. Suffice it to say there is a lot more to the poem than I can do justice, much of it requires decoding, but here are some more highlights:

We are all but players

The truth obfuscated under multiple layersHollywood elites relying on surveillance capitalism to peddle their

subpar slob

Weinstein’s Jabba the hut blob

DNC chairs did a Bernie nomination rob

America not yet ready for a Democratic Socialist heartthrobThe myth of the Golden Donkey

Prometheus turns into a Charlottesville honkeyDivide and Rule

The first lesson in Empires School

A mass media tool

Alternatives RuleIt may not be good for America, but it’s damn good for CBS

Lugenpresse

Powerful words, that tragically will never be heard or understood by many people. Having enjoyed this type of conscious poetry&#x2F; lyrics for a long time, and also having written some myself, I feel a sorrowful kinship with Gupta that goes deep. I just wish he and his family could know that at least his sacrifice was not lost on me and a handful of other people out there.

A reddit post provided a little more diverse detail, links, and comments, taking us further down the rabbit hole. One particular comment clued me into some of Gupta’s visual art on his website. I had to use to Wayback Machine to even access the site, which was scrubbed within weeks, may he rest in peace.

About Me: “Born in New Delhi, Raised in the DC area, educated in the school of hard-knocks; Arnav now lives in the Bay Area. After a fulfilling career in the intersection of Education, News-Media, Artificial Intelligence, and Global Politics, the artist now enjoys working on less weightier subjects such as nature-scapes, wildlife, and portraiture. He aspires to one day write fantasy literature in the mold of his favorites: C. S. Lewis, J.R. Tolkein, and Roald Dahl.” — Arnamania.com

The caption reads: “While I was volunteering as an Anti-Racism activist in a home-school cooperative in Washington, DC the 2016 Presidential Elections were underway. It was a very tense time that involved drivers trying to run me off the road as I home returned from work. Marines on motorcycles dangling nooses from their handlebars as they overtook me on the beltway. You must have heard about the Gorilla that was shot in the Zoo when a child fell into the enclosure. Well this was a political message being sent to me. Politicizing my art gave “Art Appreciation” a meaning that I could never have imagined. Below you can see some of my students with their class mascot, a black panther. “Harambe or Black Panther: The world is as you see it.” Being a pioneer Artificial Intelligence guinea pig was highly amusing at times, confusing at times, and scary as well. When your data is weaponized with military efficiency, the results can be amusing and at times highly destructive. Information security is the battle-ground that we now operate on. Many of you must have heard about Huawei’s recent troubles gaining the trust of western countries. In a world where one spymaster is constantly trying to outwit rivals, he who controls the data controls the world. Being caught up in between the rivalry of MNC’s that wield the full power of nation-states was truly something that I could never have imagined.” — Arnamania.com

The caption reads: “Heavy lies the head that wears the crown.” “Be careful what you wish for.” The stories we learn as children define the outcomes that we manifest in life. The myths of our combined past define our communal existence, but it is our free will that allows us to interpret our history and to chart a new and more prosperous future. Those who can not consciously and honestly understand and accept our own self-imposed pain will be forced to relive our traumas throughout the ages. Overcoming the shadows of our bestial nature is a task that every man can aspire to yet few have the courage to. It is a task worthy of our inner King.” — Arnamania.com

His website (now deleted) had an unrelated post on the day of his final act (May 29, 2019) simply titled “the complete beginner’s guide to oil painting art on canvas”, nothing to do with the dramatic event that would unfold in DC. He just wanted to teach the world how to art. After being neutralized in the park, Gupta was taken to the hospital but did not survive. The news of his life and death was over in 24 hours.

One thoughtful but brief treatment of Gupta’s case came from Petula Dvorak, writing for the Washington Post: Self-immolation can be a form of protest. Or a cry for help. Are we listening? (May 30, 2019).

“Whatever Arnav Gupta was trying to tell us when he set himself on fire Wednesday near the White House while wearing a USA T-shirt, America needs to listen. Self-immolation is a shocking, final act, the primal scream of a person who is feeling completely unheard. And it has long been the ultimate act of political protest.” — Dvorak

Dvorak’s article is short overall, and gives much of its space to other cases of self-immolation, which seem more common than one would expect. It happens for all sorts of reasons; protesting corruption, poor healthcare, racism, climate change, war in general, etc… It is almost too horrific to really understand. Given what a prominent phenomenon self-immolation takes historically, we should not be naive, pessimistic, or disinterested on such occasions. While Gupta’s case is not as clear cut as others, sometimes these acts are very explicit, such as the case with David Buckel (please remember his name too). As the Guardian reported, David Buckel, prominent New York LGBT lawyer, dies after setting himself on fire (April 15th, 2018);

A prominent gay rights lawyer and environmental advocate has burned himself to death in New York on Saturday, reportedly using fossil fuel in a protest against ecological destruction. — Guardian, 2018

I remember this day just like I remember the day Arnav Gupta self-immolated. Buckel’s death was slightly bigger news and more resonant, since he was already a well known lifelong activist, and left a profound and direct message with his suicide. Nevertheless, the depth of the meta-crisis he was expressing did not reach the public discourse. I recall hearing tidbits come from various outlets. I mourned the loss of this man, and I scorned the loss of his clear message in the noise of culture wars. (What does it take to stop people in their tracks, a pandemic? Apparently. And even that is not enough). There is something additionally haunting that we have such clear video and pictures of Gupta’s self-immolation and none of Buckel’s, to my knowledge.

Just as I publish this a year after Gupta, a year after Buckel’s self-immolation, J. Oliver Conroy wrote on it: A lawyer set himself on fire to protest climate change. Did anyone care? (The Guardian, April 15th, 2019). Indeed, this is the question, as with Gupta, and with all of them, and everything. Does anyone care? Who cares enough? What does caring look like? Conroy brings us back to the scene of Buckel’s death to prime our emotions:

“Early on the morning of 14 April 2018, Buckel — a 60-year-old retired gay rights attorney — left his cozy, garden-surrounded Brooklyn house and walked to nearby Prospect Park. He made his way to a stretch of grass, where he emailed media outlets a statement decrying humanity’s passivity in the face of pollution and global warming. A few minutes later, he doused himself in gasoline and set himself on fire.“Most humans on the planet now breathe air made unhealthy by fossil fuels, and many die early deaths as a result,” his statement said. “[M]y early death by fossil fuel reflects what we are doing to ourselves.”With characteristic care, he also left a short note at the scene for emergency personnel. “I am David Buckel and I just killed myself by fire as a protest suicide,” he wrote. “I apologize to you for the mess.” — A lawyer set himself on fire to protest climate change. Did anyone care? (The Guardian, April 15th, 2019)

The tragic profundity of Buckel’s life and legacy speaks for itself, to those who can listen, but we have to remember and echo these messages. Conroy’s thorough essay recounts other historically notable cases of self-immolation, such as Thich Quang Duc (pictured below), Jan Palach, and Mohamed Bouazizi, taking us into the relevant history and discourse. The article goes through Buckel’s prominent career as a lawyer and environmentalist, winning many landmark cases. Conroy notes how far Buckel’s cultural impact reached, such as the case portrayed in Boys Don’t Cry (1999), for which Hillary Swank won an Academy award, and yet as we regress it seems to make no difference.

Amidst all this, Conroy is lamenting the failure of the world to still really listen to Buckel’s story and to care when he died, how he died, and most importantly, why he died. Buckel died for our continued collective negligence and sins against the Earth. Buckel lived for the world, to fight for it, while most people do nothing but take from it. He died of desperation, forsaken by the world he tried to save. Conroy decries the story getting swallowed by a 24-hr news cycle obsessed with the Mueller probe and Syria strikes, at the time.

“The mass action Buckel had hoped for did not come. There was no Prague spring or Tunisian revolution for the planet. Writing in the New York Times less than a week later, the novelist Nathan Englander asked why Buckel’s death received so little attention compared with the “AR-15-level attention that we give the very worst among us”, mass killers.” — A lawyer set himself on fire to protest climate change. Did anyone care? (The Guardian, April 15th, 2019)

Towards the end of his article Conroy pivots to things like Extinction Rebellion, the Sunrise Movement, and UN reports to make the case for immediate action on global transformation. Coincidently, the anniversary of Buckel’s death lined up with XR’s global wave of disobedience that week (April, 2019). Such synchronicities should be cherished, honoured, and converted into more mass action, Conroy suggests. It was only six weeks after that Arnav Gupta would set himself on fire on the White House lawn, and be ignored.

These stories of extreme self-sacrifice and political activism almost never really end once you start looking into it, as several think pieces of the last decade seem to suggest. A Brief History of Self-Immolation (Time, 2011). A Terrible Act of Reason: When Did Self-Immolation Become the Paramount Form of Protest? (New Yorker, 2012). Flames Of Protest: The History Of Self-Immolation (NPR, 2013). See also a List of political self-immolations (wiki). We need to create a world where self-immolation is unthinkable, rather than an end point of a long chain of evil causation. But why does changing the world seem so futile that so many humans are driven to the brink? We need to listen to the cry of the Earth, especially through those voices that bare the burden the most, like Arnav Gupta.
