This guest post was written by Sabina Sagynbayeva, a graduate student at Stony Brook University. She graduated from Nazarbayev University in Kazakhstan in 2020. She is passionate about planets and stars. Now she works on the kinematics of planet formation developing hydrodynamical numerical simulations.

In 1894, Percival Lowell, the founder of the Lowell Observatory, was dreaming about finding the ninth planet in our Solar System, which he called Planet X. Unfortunately, he died without finding it, but the search for Planet X continued. Eventually, Clyde Tombaugh found Pluto, which is now a member of trans-Neptunian objects in the Kuiper belt family.

Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) follow their own rules and are randomly oriented in space. But Konstantin Batygin and Michael Brown noticed something strange happening:  some distant KBOs are aligned in one direction, and also their orbits are tilted in the same direction. To account for this preferred direction, 4 years ago they hypothesized another world in our Solar System – Planet 9. Though it gives an elegant explanation to the perturbations of the trans-Neptunian objects with exceptionally long and elongated orbits, it has never been observed. Batygin and Brown are working hard with the Subaru Telescope to find it; until then, it remains known as the Planet 9 Hypothesis. However, not everyone believes to the given hypothesis, mainly citing the effect of observational biases. In today’s paper authors address those biases and discuss the statistical significance of the clustering.

The Planet 9 Hypothesis relies on clustering of distant KBOs that also have to be aligned in one direction with their orbits tilted. The important question that should therefore be answered is: are the proposed clusters real? After all, as of July 2018 only 14 of such objects were found – not 14,000. The authors decided to attempt to answer this question by looking at the longitude of perihelion bias (or bias in the alignment) and at the orbital pole bias (or bias in the tilt of the orbits) separately, as well as the both of them combined.

Considering the alignment bias first, they looked at the 14 known KBOs with perihelion beyond Neptune and semimajor axis beyond 230 AU (distant KBOs). They attempted to answer the question statistically, excluding Planet 9 from this study. The authors ran a simulation with random 100,000 observations of uniformly distributed alignments for each of 14 KBOs, and represented the average as black dots in Fig. 1. They noticed that only 4% of them were as strongly clustered as the real data (represented as the red dot on the right panel of Fig. 1), and the other 96% fall near zero (enclosed within the red ellipse). Here, we have 1-in-25 chance that this happened by random. This is quite a low probability of the KBOs being clustered randomly, which strengthens the idea that the clustering is not just an observational bias.

By making an analysis analogous to the abovementioned one, they examined the bias in the tilts. The results showed that there were only 3.5% of the orbits were tilted (Fig. 2).

Now let’s see what happens if we combine both the longitudes of perihelion and the position of the pole biases. Because of the dependency of the two cases, the authors had to calculate the probability combining the two cases. The resulting probability was even smaller than one would even expect. There is only 0.2% chance of the strong clustering of the longitudinal perihelions and the orbital pole positions! This result emphasizes the importance of the statistical significance of the clustering.

A quite recent result from the OSSOS survey, which looks for the worlds beyond Neptune, claims that there is no clustering. The problem was that the 4 distant KBOs, that were observed by OSSOS, were not clustered. The authors of today’s paper decided to examine those observations. They applied the same technique as discussed above but on the 4 KBOs discovered by OSSOS (Fig. 3). The result can be seen in the red contours, which enclose 85% of the points, in the left panel of Fig. 3. Therefore, there is only a 15% chance that the simulated OSSOS objects would be more clustered than the real OSSOS objects. For the further examination, the authors used an alternate method to compute biases using the reported bias function. Repeating the analysis using this alternate method, the strong clustering could be detected at the 65% confidence level. Using these numbers, the authors conclude that even if the clustering was as strong as expected, the OSSOS survey was statistically incapable of confidently detecting the clustering due to the limited region of the survey and small number of detected objects. They claim that OSSOS might find the objects that do not cluster, and this is acceptable within the framework of the Planet 9 hypothesis.

None of the above analyses give a direct answer as to whether the Planet 9 is out there or not. However, something might have caused the clusters of the distant KBOs, and Planet 9 is an elegant solution to them. So, even though Pluto is not a planet anymore, Lowell’s dream might still come true through Mike Brown and Konstantin Batygin and their Planet 9.
