A suspicious substance found at the White House has reportedly been determined to be cocaine.

The substance, which was found inside the White House&#39;s West Wing on Sunday, sparked an evacuation and emergency response.

&quot;On Sunday evening, the White House complex went into a precautionary closure as officers from the Secret Service Uniformed Division investigated an unknown item found inside a work area,&quot; the U. S. Secret Service said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

&quot;The DC Fire Department was called to evaluate and quickly determined the item to be non-hazardous. The item was sent for further evaluation and an investigation into the cause and manner of how it entered the White House is pending,&quot; the statement added.

An unnamed official reportedly familiar with the investigation reported the positive test for cocaine in the suspicious item, according to The Washington Post.
