Climate activists interrupted a match on one of Wimbledon’s show courts on Wednesday, scattering orange confetti and jigsaw pieces.

Two Just Stop Oil protesters ran onto Court 18 during the first-round match between 21st-seed Grigor Dimitrov and Japanese qualifier Sho Shimabukuro

A man sat down near the net and removed his jacket while a woman was escorted away by officials.

One fan shouted “Get off the court” as others booed and jeered.

Just Stop Oil wants the UK government to end all new oil and gas exploration and has promised not to let up in its protests until it does so.

The group, which has disrupted many other high-profile sporting events, issued a statement confirming it was behind the protest.

“The supporters threw environmentally friendly orange confetti glitter and jigsaw pieces onto the court, before being removed,” it said in a statement.

“Play was briefly delayed whilst marshals picked up the pieces.”

Simon Milner-Edwards, 66, who took part in the action, said in the statement: “I’m here for my grandchildren and everybody else’s.

“I’m not prepared to let our politicians wreck everything and leave the next generation to pick up the pieces.”

Wimbledon chiefs have tightened security at the All England Club following demonstrations elsewhere.

Three protesters from Just Stop Oil ran onto the ground during the second Ashes cricket Test at Lord’s last week, sprinkling the group’s trademark orange powder.

There were similar demonstrations during the recent World Snooker Championship and English Premiership rugby final, while the group has also targeted Premier League matches.
