Former White House press secretary and current MSNBC host Jen Psaki was named several times by a federal judge who is temporarily preventing White House officials from meeting with tech companies about social media censorship.

The injunction said that Psaki &quot;publicly began pushing Facebook and other social-media platforms to censor COVID-19 misinformation&quot; on May 5, 2021.

&quot;At a White House Press Conference, Psaki publicly reminded Facebook and other social-media platforms of the threat of ‘legal consequences’ if they do not censor misinformation more aggressively,&quot; it continued.

The injunction by Louisiana Judge Terry A. Doughty was in response to recent lawsuits from Louisiana and Missouri attorneys general. The suits allege that the White House coerced or &quot;significantly encourage[d]&quot; tech companies to suppress free speech during the COVID-19 pandemic.

The injunction also added that Psaki said &quot;that the White House wanted every social-media platform to do more to call out misinformation and disinformation, and to uplift accurate information,&quot; during a press conference in February 2022.

Doughty is barring several federal officials and agencies – including some of Biden&#39;s Cabinet members and White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre – from contacting social media companies in efforts to suppress speech.

The injunction also states that the government&#39;s actions &quot;likely violate the Free Speech Clause&quot; and that the court &quot;is not persuaded by Defendants’ arguments.&quot;

&quot;If the allegations made by Plaintiffs are true, the present case arguably involves the most massive attack against free speech in United States’ history,&quot; the injunction said. &quot;In their attempts to suppress alleged disinformation, the Federal Government, and particularly the Defendants named here, are alleged to have blatantly ignored the First Amendment’s right to free speech.&quot;

During a July 2021 press conference, Psaki, alongside Surgeon General Murthy, told reporters that the White House was &quot;flagging problematic posts&quot; for Facebook, according to the injunction.

&quot;We are in regular touch with these social-media platforms, and those engagements typically happen through members of our senior staff, but also members of our COVID-19 team,&quot; she said, according to the injunction. &quot;We’re flagging problematic posts for Facebook that spread disinformation.&quot;

The injunction also said that it was &quot;quite telling that each example or category of suppressed speech was conservative in nature.&quot;

Doughty rejected a motion by attorneys for Psaki to block a court-ordered deposition in November 2022, and said there is public interest in &quot;determining whether First Amendment free speech rights have been suppressed.&quot;

Psaki joined MSNBC after departing the White House and debuted her Sunday show, &quot;Inside with Jen Psaki&quot; in March.

MSNBC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
