Fox News has tapped conservative commentator Jesse Watters to take over Tucker Carlson&#39;s 8 p.m. primetime show slot, the network announced Monday. The move comes more than two months after Fox abruptly fired its most popular host following a series of controversies that got executives  worried about Carlson becoming too much of a liability. Starting off Fox&#39;s primetime will be Laura Ingraham, whose show has been moved from 10 p.m. to 7 p.m. ET. Sean Hannity will stay on at 9 p.m. while comedian Greg Gutfeld&#39;s show will move from 11 p.m. to 10 p.m. News anchor Trace Gallagher will take over the 11 p.m. slot. &quot;The unique perspectives of Laura Ingraham, Jesse Watters, Sean Hannity, and Greg Gutfeld will ensure our viewers have access to unrivaled coverage from our best-in-class team for years to come,&quot; Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott said in a statement. Watters will continue to serve as a panelist on Fox&#39;s &quot;The Five&quot; before primetime hour. Watters started off his career as a production assistant at Fox, later appearing on The O&#39;Reilly Factor where he developed a reputation for &quot;ambush-style&quot; man-on-the street interviews. While on O&#39;Reilly, Watters apologized for a segment where he mocked people in Manhattan&#39;s Chinatown about cultural stereotypes. Still, the 44-year-old host became a rising star at the network and among conservative figures. Fox had a massive dip in viewership following  Carlson&#39;s dismissal, and the two are subsequently engaged in a legal battle over his contract after he signed a deal with Twitter to host his show on the social media platform.The New York Times previously reported that Fox News executives became alarmed over Carlson&#39;s increasingly radical views after his internal communications were revealed during the Dominion defamation case.
