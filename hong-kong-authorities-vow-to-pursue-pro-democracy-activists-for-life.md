The Beijing-backed Hong Kong (HK) Chief Executive John Lee has said that the eight pro-democracy activists who are currently being pursued by the Hong Kong police for allegedly breaking the island state’s National Security Law should be aware they will be pursued for life.

Mr. Lee, who made the remarks on July 4, expressed he was supportive of the police’s actions and advised those named in the arrest warrants to surrender themselves.

“I also want to tell the criminals that, well, the only way to end their destiny of being an abscondee who will be pursued for life is to surrender,” he said. “We’ll be pursuing the abscondees’ criminal responsibilities for life until they surrender themselves.”

The eight activists have been accused of “endangering” Hong Kong’s national security—more specifically, the allegations of “incitement to secession, subversion, incitement to subversion, and collusion with a foreign country.”

HK authorities have also announced they were offering $1 million (AU$191,078) rewards for information leading to an arrest of the individuals, which is the first time a reward has been offered.

Mr. Lee said that the HKA decision to pursue the activists was a signal to “everybody that endangering national security is not something we will tolerate.”

“We’ll do whatever legally to pursue the responsible person. What overseas politicians or officials say will not, in any way, change our strong belief in the need to uphold our protection of national security. I know that they have been doing things for their own political reasons, for their own political gains,” he said.

Mr. Lee also indicated that Hong Kong police would employ extraterritorial powers against criminals who have contravened their country’s law in this regard.

The eight activists, who include legislators Nathan Law, Ted Hui and Dennis Kwok, lawyer Kevin Yam, unionist Mung Siu-tat and activists Finn Lau, Anna Kwok and Elmer Yuen, now reside in the United Kingdom, the United States and Australia.

Announcing the wanted list on Monday, Steve Li, chief superintendent of the HK national security police, said 260 people aged between 15 and 90 had been arrested under the national security law, with 161 individuals and five companies being charged, and 79 people convicted.

The law has received widespread international criticism for eroding the long-running “one country, two systems” model that ensured the British-style rule of law over Hong Kong.

Australia’s Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told Australian media on July 5 that the actions of Beijing’s Hong Kong authorities were unacceptable.

“It’s just unacceptable,” Mr. Albanese told Nine’s Today program. “We are concerned about the announcements overnight that have been made.

“We will continue to cooperate with China where we can, but we will disagree where we must. And we do disagree over human rights issues.”

The prime minister also drew attention to Beijing’s continued incarceration of Australian journalist Cheng Lei, who he said was being held in China without any proper processes.

“This decision overnight is an example of where Australia and China do have different approaches to these issues. And we’ll stand up for our values,” he said.

Meanwhile, the UK’s Foreign Secretary James Cleverly said in a media statement said the UK would not tolerate any attempts by Beijing to intimidate and silence individuals in the UK and overseas.

“We will not tolerate any attempts by China to intimidate and silence individuals in the UK and overseas. The UK will always defend the universal right to freedom of expression and stand up for those who are targeted,” Mr. Cleverly said.

“We strongly object to the National Security Law that China imposed on Hong Kong, including its extraterritorial reach, in breach of the legally binding Sino-British Joint Declaration.

“We call on Beijing to remove the National Security Law and for the Hong Kong authorities to end their targeting of those who stand up for freedom and democracy.”

However, Hong Kong’s Secretary for Security, Chris Tang, has announced his department will double down on the offensive against the eight activists, with authorities seeking to cut off the dissidents’ access to finances, reported AP.

This would include freezing and confiscating their assets and investigating anyone who chooses to support them financially in Hong Kong or overseas.

Mr. Tang also warned that anyone who assists them in endangering national security may also be considered to be violating the national security law.
