President Biden called for an assault weapon ban on Independence Day amid a wave of mass shootings in cities across the nation.

&quot;Today, Jill and I grieve for those who have lost their lives and, as our nation celebrates Independence Day, we pray for the day when our communities will be free from gun violence,&quot; Biden said in a statement Tuesday. &quot;It is within our power to once again ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, to require safe storage of guns, to end gun manufacturers’ immunity from liability, and to enact universal background checks.&quot;

The comments come after a series of shootings in cities in the days leading up to Independence Day.

A man in Philadelphia killed five people Monday, four of whom were shot. A 2-year-old and a 13-year-old were injured from the shootings, according to police.

A shooting at a Fort Worth, Texas, festival left three people dead and eight others injured Monday.

Two people were killed and 28 injured during a Sunday shooting at a block party in Baltimore.

In his Independence Day statement, Biden noted the one-year anniversary of the deadly shooting in Highland Park, Illinois, at a 4th of July parade that left seven dead and 48 injured. The president specified the shooter used an AR-15 and praised Illinois Democratic Gov. J. B. Pritzker for signing a bill banning assault weapons in response.

&quot;I urge other states to follow Illinois’ lead, and continue to call upon Republican lawmakers in Congress to come to the table on meaningful, commonsense reforms that the American people support,&quot; Biden said.
